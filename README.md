<h1>Daily Tasker (Final Year Project)</h1>
Introduction
Daily Tasker is a user-friendly website application accessible to anyone with an internet connection and a web browser. You can delegate your daily chores to others, saving you precious time and effort. All you need is a device with internet access, and you can effortlessly outsource your tasks, allowing you to focus on what truly matters to you.
Our project aimed at revolutionizing the way people connect for everyday tasks. Our vision is to create a seamless platform that bridges the gap between individuals in need of physical assistance and those with the skills and willingness to help. Whether it's fixing a light bulb, cleaning a floor, or getting groceries, our platform is designed to simplify your daily life.
At the core of our project is the aspiration to build a platform that effortlessly connects people seeking assistance with various physical tasks to capable individuals who are ready to lend a helping hand. Through this platform, users can post tasks that they need assistance with, allowing others who are willing and able to complete these tasks to step in and offer their services. The beauty of this system lies in its simplicity. If you need a task done, there’s someone out there willing.

Problem Statement
In our busy lives, many of us struggle to find time for everyday tasks like cleaning, repairs, or grocery. At the same time, there are people in our communities who have the skills to help but don't have an easy way to connect with those in need.
There's a need for a simple and safe platform where people who need help and those willing to help can easily find each other. This platform should be easy to use, trustworthy, and ensure that tasks get done without any hassle. Creating such a platform would make everyday life easier for those who need assistance and allow skilled individuals to make a positive impact in their communities.

Proposed System
Our proposed system, "Daily Tasker," is designed to seamlessly connect individuals seeking assistance with everyday tasks to those willing to provide their help. This intuitive online platform can be accessed through web browsers, ensuring a user-friendly experience for anyone with internet access. One of the unique aspects of Daily Tasker is the immediate payment system, where physical task performers receive payments directly, and eliminating waiting times. To access the platform's benefits, users are required to pay a nominal monthly fee. However, the first three tasks do not require a subscription, encouraging users to explore the platform without initial costs.
Key Features
1.	User-Friendly Interface: Daily Tasker will have a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for both task seekers and task performers to navigate the platform effortlessly.
2.	Task Posting and Browsing: Users can post tasks they need assistance with, specifying details such as task description, budget, and deadline. Task performers can browse these tasks based on their skills and availability.
3.	Matching Algorithm: The platform will employ a smart matching algorithm that connects task seekers with suitable task performers, ensuring efficient and relevant matches based on expertise, location, and availability. 	
4.	Transparent Reviews and Ratings: Users can leave reviews and ratings for task performers based on their experiences. This transparent feedback system builds trust within the community and helps users make informed decisions. 
Benefits:
1.	Time Efficiency: Users can save time and energy by outsourcing tasks, allowing them to focus on more important aspects of their lives.
2.	Community Empowerment: Daily Tasker empowers community members to utilize their skills and contribute positively, fostering a sense of collaboration and support.
3.	Accessibility: Daily Tasker is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, promoting inclusivity and ensuring that assistance is available to a wide range of users.

By implementing these features and benefits, Daily Tasker aims to create a reliable, efficient, and supportive ecosystem where individuals can easily connect, help each other, and simplify their daily lives.
