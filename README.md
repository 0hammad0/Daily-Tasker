    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

    <p>
        In our busy lives, many of us struggle to find time for everyday tasks like cleaning, repairs, or grocery. At
        the same time, there are people in our communities who have the skills to help but don't have an easy way to
        connect with those in need. There's a need for a simple and safe platform where people who need help and those
        willing to help can easily find each other. This platform should be easy to use, trustworthy, and ensure that
        tasks get done without any hassle. Creating such a platform would make everyday life easier for those who need
        assistance and allow skilled individuals to make a positive impact in their communities.

    <h2>Proposed System</h2>

    <p>
        Our proposed system, <strong>Daily Tasker</strong>, is designed to seamlessly connect individuals seeking
        assistance with everyday tasks to those willing to provide their help. This intuitive online platform can be
        accessed through web browsers, ensuring a user-friendly experience for anyone with internet access. One of the
        unique aspects of Daily Tasker is the immediate payment system, where physical task performers receive payments
        directly, eliminating waiting times. To access the platform's benefits, users are required to pay a nominal
        monthly fee. However, the first three tasks do not require a subscription, encouraging users to explore the
        platform without initial costs.
